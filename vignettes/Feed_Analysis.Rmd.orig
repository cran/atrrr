# Analyzing Feeds on Blue Sky

On Blue Sky users have the ability to create custom feeds based on specific keywords. These feeds aggregate content, for instance, a user might create a feed around the hashtag `#rstats` to gather all relevant content about. Let's delve into the dynamics of such feeds created by users.

## Load the package

```{r setup}
library(atrrr)
```

## Retrieving a Feed

Our starting point is to extract the posts from a feed. We're focusing on a feed curated by "andrew.heiss.phd".


```{r}
# Fetching the feed posts
feeds <- get_feeds_created_by(actor = "andrew.heiss.phd") |>
  dplyr::glimpse()

# Filtering for a specific keyword, for example "#rstats"
rstat_feed <- feeds |>
  filter(displayName == "#rstats")

# Extracting posts from this curated feed
rstat_posts <- get_feed(rstat_feed$uri, limit = 200) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```


## Identifying Top Contributors

Who are the leading voices within a particular topic? This analysis highlights users who are frequently contributing to the `#rstats` feed.


```{r, fig.cap="Top 10 #rstats contributors"}
library(ggplot2)

# Identifying the top 10 contributors
rstat_posts |>
  count(handle = author_handle, sort = T) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  mutate(handle = forcats::fct_reorder(handle, n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(handle, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Recognizing Influential Voices

Volume doesn't always translate to influence. Some users may post less frequently but their contributions resonate deeply with the community.

```{r, fig.cap="Top 10 #rstats contributors based on likes"}
# Identifying top 10 influential voices based on likes
rstat_posts |>
  group_by(author_handle) |>
  summarize(like_count = sum(like_count)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(like_count)) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  mutate(handle = forcats::fct_reorder(author_handle, like_count)) |>
  ggplot(aes(handle, like_count)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Most Famous #rstats skeet

```{r}
# Finding the standout post in the rstats feed
rstat_posts |>
  mutate(total_interactions = reply_count + repost_count + like_count) |>
  arrange(desc(total_interactions)) |>
  slice(1) |>
  select(author_handle, total_interactions, text) |>
  dplyr::glimpse() |>
  pull(text)
```
